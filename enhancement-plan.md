# Recipe Form and IngredientSelector UI Enhancement Plan

## Current State Analysis

After examining the current implementation of the recipe form and ingredient selector components, I've identified the following key aspects:

1. **Recipe Form Structure**
   - The form allows users to add recipes manually or import via image upload
   - Basic sections include title, meal type, diet type, ingredients, instructions, and photo upload
   - The form switches between manual entry and import mode

2. **IngredientSelector Component**
   - Recently updated to display separate fields for amount, unit, and ingredient name
   - Provides autocomplete suggestions from a Firestore database
   - Allows adding, editing, and removing ingredients

3. **OCR Functionality**
   - Uses Tesseract.js for text extraction from images
   - Parses extracted text to identify recipe components (title, ingredients, instructions)
   - Ingredients are parsed with regex to extract amount, unit, and ingredient name

4. **Current UI Limitations**
   - Limited visual feedback during OCR processing
   - Basic autocomplete for ingredients without categorization
   - No drag-and-drop for image uploads or ingredient reordering
   - Limited mobile responsiveness for ingredient fields

## Enhancement Goals

1. Improve the visual design and user experience of the recipe form
2. Enhance the ingredient selector with better autocomplete and organization
3. Create a smoother transition between manual entry and OCR import
4. Improve mobile responsiveness for all components

    C --> C3[Bulk Edit Options]
    
    D --> D1[Ingredient Categorization]
    D --> D2[Favorites/Recent Ingredients]
    D --> D3[Ingredient Search Filters]
```

#### Implementation Details:

1. **Enhanced Autocomplete**
   - Improve the matching algorithm to support fuzzy search
   - Show recently used ingredients at the top of suggestions
   - Add ingredient categories in the suggestion dropdown
   - Include common ingredient combinations as suggestions
   - Implement keyboard navigation for suggestions

2. **Improved Ingredient Display**
   - Create a more visually appealing ingredient list with cards
   - Add subtle color coding for different ingredient categories
   - Implement drag-and-drop reordering using react-beautiful-dnd
   - Add bulk edit capabilities for multiple ingredients
   - Include a "clear all" option for ingredients

3. **Smart Unit Handling**
   - Replace the unit text input with a dropdown of common units
   - Add unit conversion functionality (e.g., convert between metric and imperial)
   - Support fraction input for measurements with proper display
   - Add validation for amount fields (numbers and fractions only)

4. **Ingredient Organization**
   - Add ability to group ingredients by category (produce, dairy, etc.)
   - Implement collapsible sections for ingredient groups
   - Add a favorites or frequently used ingredients section
   - Include a search filter for the ingredient list

### 3. OCR and Image Upload Improvements
