In a large bowl, toss the sweet potatoes with the olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread out the sweet potatoes in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 30 minutes, or until they start to brown and look crispy. Meanwhile, make the sandwiches: Put the corned beef and sauerkraut in two small baking pans, casserole dishes, or ramekins. Put them in the oven with the fries during the last 10 minutes, to warm them. Toast the bread. Spread each piece of toasted bread with about 1/4 cup of the dressing. Take the corned beef and sauerkraut out of the oven. Divide the corned beef between the two slices of bread. Add the pickles or serve them on the side. Top with the sauerkraut. Serve with the sweet potato fries on the side.",

Form into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375°F. In a wide pot over medium-high heat, add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Add the onions and cook, stirring frequently, until golden brown. Add the next 6 ingredients (carrots through sage). Stir the arrowroot into the coconut or almond milk to dissolve, then add to the pot, stirring until the sauce is slightly thickened. Divide the filling among 8 1-cup ramekins. Roll out the crust between two sheets of parchment paper, cut out 8 circles, and place one on top of each ramekin. Sprinkle lightly with sea salt and bake for 30 minutes. Serve warm.",
